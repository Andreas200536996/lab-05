                In the year 2003, the world was forever changed as in the small town of Parry Sound, <em>I was born</em>! Even as a newborn infant I was <em>vastly superior</em> to 
            the other babies. From my ability to crawl like a race car to my elegantly groomed appearance, I was truly a sight to behold.

                I began making headway with my ambition when I hit highschool and started to find my path forward, which so happened to be when
            an accident changed my future. Where I was supposed to be in a Grade 9 business class I was accidentally put into a Grade 10 
            programming class where I learned to love the proffession, and have now chosen to pursue it in college.

                My fondest accomplishment is that I managed to achieve my Grade 9 in piano while maintaining a <em>full courseload</em> throughout 
            highschool. While I am happy with my current accomplishment, I strive to obtain my diploma in software development and to further
            my knowledge by obtaining a degree in business.
